<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dyslexic Full stack develeloper student 
  enrolled in Angela Yu's full stack developer bootcamp.
  I was very hesistant on pursing a career in web development as the coding 
  at first glance looks very intimidating.
  However as I have dug deeper into the modules of the course and also discovered
  a font called opendyslexia, I find that I am getting the hang of it and having fun too!
  Thanks to Angela's teaching style she leaves room for error without making one feel 
  like a failure.
  My end goal is to become a full time full stack developer and 
  continue streaming as well full time, being my own boss.
